<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>SCENE ONE&mdash;A road through a forest. On either side</i>
<i>trees stand thick and dark. Immediately in front the light</i>
<i>sifts down upon a rude bridge spanning a narrow stream.</i>
<i>At the roadside, to the right, a large crucifix, apparently</i>
<i>new, stands upon a post some ten feet in height. It is</i>
<i>elaborately carved and is set in a deep frame to protect it</i>
<i>from the weather. At the foot of the post, cut into the</i>
<i>mossy bank which slopes toward the road, is a kneeling</i>
<i>place with a white sheep's pelt lying upon it.</i></p>

<p><i>A sound of voices is heard. Fritz and Rudolph enter</i>
<i>from the left and pause where a path leads off through</i>
<i>the wood. The latter has an ax upon his shoulder. Far in</i>
<i>the forest a faint sound of chopping is heard.</i></p>

<p><i>TIME&mdash;Mid-day in summer, in the early part of the thirteenth</i>
<i>century.</i></p></div>

<p><i>SCENE TWO&mdash;Under an old beech in the edge of the</i>
<i>forest. A knoll, like the toe of a large boot shoved in</i>
<i>from the rear, butts squarely against the trunk. Up under</i>
<i>the boughs, left, lies a decaying log with here and there</i>
<i>a tuft of rank grass growing from the cores of old knots.</i>
<i>Beside it is a small basket filled with berries. At the</i>
<i>foot of the beech, bubbles a spring partly walled in with</i>
<i>dark mossy rocks, on top of which lies a brown gourd</i>
<i>dipper. Two worn foot-paths, one winding up the slope</i>
<i>into the forest, the other entering from the left, meet at</i>
<i>the spring. The ground is checkered with flakes of sunlight</i>
<i>that fall through the leaves, and over all is the silence</i>
<i>of the summer noon.</i></p>

<p><i>A crackle is heard as of a dry twig breaking under foot.</i>
<i>The branches on the left swing apart and Selma pushes</i>
<i>through backwards. She is a fairy-like creature dressed</i>
<i>in green. Her hair falls loose about her shoulders and</i>
<i>upon her head she wears a coronet of wild-flowers. Holding</i>
<i>the boughs slightly apart, she stands peering intently</i>
<i>to the left, then, turning quickly, she snatches up the basket</i>
<i>and hides it behind the log, and after picking a few green</i>
<i>burrs from the branches above her, darts to the right and</i>
<i>conceals herself behind the trunk. For a time she stands</i>
<i>motionless. Then, as if upon second thought, she stoops</i>
<i>and removes the dipper from the rocks.</i></p>

<p><i>Along the foot-path, leading in from the left, Oswald enters.</i>
<i>He stops and looks back and for a time stands thus, as one</i>
<i>undecided, a forlorn expression upon his face. He then</i>
<i>turns and proceeds to the spring. Not finding the dipper,</i>
<i>he lays aside his staff and hat, and stretches himself</i>
<i>out upon the flat stone at the entrance of the spring.</i>
<i>While he is drinking, Selma leans cautiously from behind</i>
<i>the trunk and raises her arm as if to drop something.</i>
<i>Having evidently seen her shadow in the water, Oswald</i>
<i>glances up, but seeing no one, lies down again and drinks.</i>
<i>From behind the hole Selma tosses a burr into the spring.</i>
<i>Oswald continues to drink. Finally he rises, and, taking</i>
<i>up his hat and staff, goes up the slope and sits down upon</i>
<i>the log. The girl moves stealthily around the trunk.</i></p></div>

<i>white beard and his hands are folded on top of a tall</i>
<i>rustic staff. The others are Fritz and Rudolph and Wiglaf,</i>

<p><i>SCENE ONE&mdash;A forest on the mountain tops, the great</i>
<i>trees glooming with the shadows of nightfall. In the</i>
<i>distance, between the dark boles, patches of sky with the</i>
<i>fading light of evening. The scene slopes down into</i>
<i>a clump of tangle-wood on the left. Up the slope, upon</i>
<i>a stump that stands out from among the trees, Selma is</i>
<i>sitting with her head bowed, her face almost hidden by her</i>
<i>hair which has fallen forward across her shoulders. She</i>
<i>is dressed in dappled fawn-skin. In her hand she has a</i>
<i>spray of dog-wood blossoms from which she is thoughtlessly</i>
<i>tearing the leaves. From the thicket below, three</i>
<i>fairies steal in one after another, having in their hands</i>

<p><i>SCENE TWO&mdash;A mountain cavern with jutting ledges of</i>
<i>rock. From the bones that lie about, one would imagine</i>
<i>it to be a den to which wild beasts drag and devour their</i>
<i>prey. To the right, a vine, growing out of the crevice in</i>
<i>the rear wall, shows by its leaves becoming a darker green</i>
<i>as it spreads to the right that the entrance is in that direction</i>
<i>and near by. Bowlders, evidently used for seats, lie</i>
<i>here and there, and in the rear, center, a smouldering</i>
<i>fire throws their shadows about the floor and walls. Several</i>
<i>willow baskets freshly woven hang on pegs driven</i>
<i>into seams in the rocks. To the left, an old spinning</i>
<i>wheel with a thread trailing from it, and near it, upon</i>
<i>the floor, a quantity of black wool. Farther over in the</i>
<i>corner, a couch of rushes and forest grass. From the</i>
<i>ledge that projects out over it hang bunches of dry herbs.</i>
<i>In the left wall, extending to the ceiling and barely wide</i>
<i>enough to admit of one's passing through, is a cleft whence</i>
<i>are heard at intervals the muffled sound of hammers far</i>
<i>down in the earth.</i></p>

<p><i>To the right of the fire, Sigurd, the dwarf, is peeling osiers.</i>
<i>He is barefooted. About his neck he wears a string of</i>
<i>buckeyes. Beside him, upon the floor, lies a pile of white</i>
<i>osiers newly peeled. Occasionally he takes the withes in</i>
<i>his mouth and tears the bark off with his teeth. On the</i>
<i>other side of the fire, reclining upon his elbow, the gnome</i>
<i>Kilo is poking the coals with a stick.</i></p>

<span class="i0">A while ago I started up from sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurried to the kennel, thinking sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd find old Fever sick again; but no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitch was sleeping. And yet I heard a howl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may have been the white hound in my dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to be out on the mountain there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas early morning; a few stars still shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the village. Soon, far down the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a baying as of hounds. Thinks I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A deer has passed and waked the village dogs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now for a chase." There must have been a slot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fresh blood on the road that fired the pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on they came like mad. Around the cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long bodies swung like shadows through the mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore on up the mountain. Farther up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stag plunged from a hazel copse, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A snow-white talbot, following close behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot smoking from the brake. "Abloy!" I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaped upon a rock. The after-pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nosing the vent along the mountain road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the loud challenge of the leading hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, breaking trail, came crashing through the brush<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And spied the quarry, and with their heads in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang after up the scree, their steaming mouths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringing the mountains round. The pretty deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nostrils flaming and with dappled flanks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn by the furze, came skirting round a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned to dash under some low-hung boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When over a near knoll the hot, sinewy hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a cat-o'-mountain from a limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot through the air. Crash through the boughs he went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkling the earth with leaves. Out jumped my knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, leaping from the rock, I hurried down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slit the poor brute's throat and save a steak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the mad, hungry pack. The pretty buck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staggered beneath the hound, while the beads of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripped from the quivering hocks. The head fell back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender haunches sank on the soft turf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death was closing up the eyes, when lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sancta Maria, what a miracle!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gray in the heavens when the chase began,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grappled the woods and threw his thick, green hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the swirling rack of livid sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightnings and thunders, winds and tumbling rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charged on the pack of dogs as though they were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devils come up from Hell, and hurled them down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the pit again. Under the beech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the white talbot had pulled down the buck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the miracle the Virgin wrought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of a dallop of green boughs that hung<br /></span>

<p><i>SCENE TWO&mdash;The courtyard of the abbey, as in Scene</i>
<i>three of the second act. The large crucifix which was</i>
<i>seen in the forest in the first Act is fixed above the door of</i>
<i>the chapel. On either side of the door is a stained glass</i>
<i>window, the farther one depicting the Transfiguration,</i>
<i>the nearer one, the legend of St. Giles. The deer with</i>
<i>blood dripping from a wound in its haunch stands behind</i>
<i>the saint who holds in his hand an arrow with blood upon</i>
<i>its tip. The emporer and his huntsmen are presenting</i>
<i>the saint with golden cups. The deer is watching them.</i>
<i>Several rude benches of stone are ranged alongside of the</i>
<i>dormitory. In the rear, about ten feet back from the</i>
<i>building, a low stone wall extends across, passing behind</i>
<i>the dormitory on the one side and the chapel on the other.</i>
<i>To the left, far back, is seen the side of the mountain on</i>
<i>which the abbey stands. The upper part is thickly wooded,</i>
<i>and below, where the timber is sparse, a road winds down</i>
<i>the cliff to the village. Farther down, the slope becomes</i>
<i>more precipitous and is covered with bowlders and</i>
<i>stunted evergreens, some of which have been broken off</i>
<i>by rocks tumbling from the cliff above. Off to the right,</i>
<i>a space of sky with the snow-peaks flashing in the sunlight.</i>
<i>To the left in the last Scene, they are now far to</i>
<i>the right.</i></p>

<p><i>From a door in the dormitory facing the court, Ely and</i>
<i>Pierre enter. The former has a hunting horn suspended</i>
<i>from his shoulder by a chain, and in his hand a small</i>
<i>wooden crucifix. Pierre carries two large silver candelabra.</i>
<i>They come out talking.</i></p></div>

<span class="i0">One Sabbath while the morning star still burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lone white taper, on a sudden from his couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient bellman started. The old chime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was singing in its tower, and, like a thrush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That eyeless hath escaped a narrow cage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of Raphael on his bough again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang through the woods. The eagles on the crags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook out their wings and circled in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain shepherds shouted from the rocks,<br /></span>

<p><i>SCENE FOUR&mdash;Before the church which stands about</i>
<i>twenty feet back from the street. Low stone fences on</i>
<i>either side project in to its corners and form with its front</i>
<i>three sides of a hexagon. To the right, in a higher fence,</i>
<i>also of stone, which runs parallel with the street, is an iron</i>
<i>gate, overgrown with vines, leading into the churchyard.</i>
<i>Between the palings can be seen white crosses marking</i>
<i>the graves. In the corners, just where the fences start in</i>
<i>toward the church, stand Lombardy poplars in full foliage,</i>
<i>one on either side. The church is built of rough stone,</i>
<i>with irregular seams of white mortar. In the center is</i>
<i>an arched doorway and beside it two false windows almost</i>
<i>covered with ivy. High up over the door is seen the</i>
<i>lower part of a narrow louvre window with several long</i>
<i>straws, which the birds have carried there, hanging down</i>
<i>from between the slats.</i></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

<p><i>In the open space before the church, a crowd is gathered.</i>
<i>Upon the steps with his back to the door stands Jardin,</i>
<i>the Bailiff. He wears a sleeveless hauberk wrought of</i>
<i>chain, and upon his head a heavy open helmet. Some</i>
<i>distance to the right, upon a step lower down, Jacques Sar,</i>
<i>wearing a leather corselet and a cap of wolf skin, is leaning</i>
<i>with his right hand against the church. His right</i>
<i>arm is off near the shoulder. The crowd is made up of</i>
<i>men, for the most part in their working clothes. Some</i>
<i>have no hats on. Among the latter is Hugh Capet, whose</i>
<i>red head is seen far in near the steps. Jules Bacqueur,</i>
<i>with his sleeves rolled up, stands on the edge of the</i>
<i>crowd. Out in the street to the left, is a group of women.</i>
<i>A boy is up in the poplar tree, right.</i></p>

<p><i>As the Scene progresses, other villagers enter, among them</i>
<i>the women of the last Scene.</i></p></div>

<span class="i0">When we were storming Acre. The Infidel,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Low in the dust. The waves of battle clapped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his head. Barred in with dripping spears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Turk and Christian, raged the bleeding whelp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His paws red-clotted in his own hot blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleaving the gloom, a burst of crimson light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed down the slanting spears and like a prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled back the waves of war. Between the crests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of foam-white faces holy St. Augustine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came walking down the bodies of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting the Lion, fired him. At once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose on the night the planet of his shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning a lane before his falchion fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the slope into the Turks he swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through dropping shields and sabers thrown in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lurid streak of flame. So Jardin now,<br /></span>

<p><i>SCENE TWO&mdash;The scriptorium in the dormitory of the abbey.</i>
<i>The walls are of stone. In the left wall, near the</i>
<i>corner, a door opens into a hall that leads thence to the</i>
<i>courtyard. Near it, forward, an enormous chest with</i>
<i>metal trimmings and handles of embossed stags' heads,</i>
<i>the antlers gradually disappearing into the panel. Upon</i>
<i>the chest, as though thrown there carelessly, lies a heavy</i>
<i>cloak. About ten feet from the door, against the rear</i>
<i>wall, stands a small priedieu covered with a rich altar-cloth</i>
<i>interwoven with the figure&mdash;seen in old arras&mdash;of St. Giles</i>
<i>sitting upon a rock with the deer resting its head in his</i>
<i>lap. Behind the deer is a clump of brambles. The</i>
<i>kneeling piece, which projects from under the folds of</i>
<i>the altar-cloth, is of dark wood highly polished. Upon</i>
<i>it is a scarlet cushion. A little above the priedieu, in a</i>
<i>semicircular niche in the wall, is set a bronze crucifix some</i>
<i>ten inches in height. Before it burns a small taper. Farther</i>
<i>to the right, a second door leading into a corridor</i>
<i>which connects with the sleeping apartments. Between</i>
<i>this door and the priedieu are shelves filled with books and</i>
<i>old manuscripts. Beyond the door, which swings in and</i>
<i>is partly open, an old buckler hangs upon the wall, and beneath</i>
<i>it, upon two iron spikes, a long spear. Between the</i>
<i>spear and buckler is fixed a parchment cut mitriform and</i>
<i>bearing in large illumined letters the inscriptions</i> <span class="smcap">Hugh de</span>
<span class="smcap">Buillon cum deo et cum godefrido nicaeis antiochiis</span>
<span class="smcap">hierosolymis mil nonag sept oct nov.</span> <i>Farther to the</i>
<i>right, in the corner, a Saracen coat-of-mail filled with</i>
<i>spears which, converging center and spread out above and</i>
<i>below, look like a sheaf of steel. Across the breast of the</i>
<i>coat-of-mail is a strip of parchment with the inscription</i>
<i>illumined as before</i>: A <span class="smcap">MOHAMED FILIO SATAN CHRISTO</span>
<span class="smcap">FILIO DEI</span>. <i>In the right wall are apertures of two deep-set</i>
<i>windows, near which are three carrels, each with an old</i>
<i>manuscript spread out upon it and ink-pots and other copying</i>
<i>and illuminating materials. Hanging beside them are</i>
<i>finger rags smeared with various colored stains. On one</i>
<i>of the carrels lies a sprig of flowering mountain laurel.</i>
<i>Near the center of the room, a few feet to the right, stands</i>
<i>a long table running parallel with the side walls. It is</i>
<i>overstrewn with old manuscripts, some of them discolored</i>
<i>and half unrolled; others, near the forward end, piled in</i>
<i>the form of a miniature pyramid. Farther back, a small</i>
<i>brass lamp, pitcher-shaped and with a wick protruding</i>

<p><i>To the right of the table, in a square, high-backed chair with</i>
<i>animal-feet, sits the Abbot in a black gown, bareheaded.</i>
<i>His feet, which are under the table, are cased in slippers</i>
<i>of sheep-skin with the white fleece still upon it. From his</i>
<i>right hand, which hangs beside his chair, a scroll of parchment</i>
<i>trails upon the floor. Farther back, upon the opposite</i>
<i>side of the table, stands the Priest, his left hand resting</i>
<i>upon the back of a chair the front legs of which are</i>
<i>raised a few inches from the floor. At the further end</i>
<i>of the table Oswald is standing with his finger wiping</i>
<i>away the tears that trinkle down his cheeks.</i></p>

<p><i>Thunder is heard intermittently, and from time to time the</i>
<i>windows are shaken by the violence of the wind.</i></p></div>

<p><i>SCENE ONE&mdash;A street in the village. Low thatched cottages,</i>
<i>with deep, wide eaves overhanging the street, stand</i>
<i>in a dark mass. To the left, a little way from the others</i>
<i>and back a few paces from the street, is a small house, the</i>
<i>home of Jardin. Through a window in the room on the</i>
<i>right side comes a faint light as from a low-burning lamp.</i>
<i>To the left of the window, one feels that there is a door,</i>
<i>though, either on account of intervening bushes or perhaps</i>
<i>because of a porch that makes it darker there, one</i>
<i>does not see it. Out in the yard where the light from the</i>
<i>window falls upon the bushes near the casement, the</i>
<i>glistening of the leaves shows that it has been raining.</i>
<i>The windows of the other houses, like vacant eyes under</i>
<i>deep brows, are dark, and there are no signs of life anywhere.</i>
<i>Over the roofs and through the great trees that</i>
<i>rise up behind them flows a greyness that emphasizes the</i>
<i>quiet of the hour. About the street lie several limbs that</i>
<i>were broken off by the storm during the night.</i></p>
